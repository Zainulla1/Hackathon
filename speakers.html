                <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
                <h5>Designing a culture of design</h5>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbangs, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, <br> 
                and it doesn't end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. it's the unwritten rules <br>
                behaviour,beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it's <br>
                valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
                <p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that <br>*get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, <br> and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to  <br> change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of <br> design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
                <h5 style="color: #bcb2b9; padding-top: 20px;">About Aaron</h5>
                <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy <br> metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and <br> presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at <br> discussingdesign.com.</p>

                     <h5>Lights! camera! Interaction design inspiration from filmmakers</h5>
                     <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a <br> combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the  <br> filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools <br> and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, <br> foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told  <br> story.</p>
                      <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on <br> the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in  <br> film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why  <br> they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
                       <h5>About Adam</h5>
                       <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, <br> communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with <br> Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience  <br> design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create <br> effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter <br>
                         how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story  <br> is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <br> adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.</p>

                <h5>Death to wireframes are a drag long rapid prototyping</h5>
                <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes <br> things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups  <br> while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br> 
                    is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration  <br> process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
